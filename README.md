FizzBuzz Program

Description

This is a simple Java program that implements the classic FizzBuzz challenge. The program prints numbers from 1 to 100, but with a twist:

For numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz".


For numbers divisible by 3, it prints "Fizz".

For numbers divisible by 5, it prints "Buzz".

For numbers not divisible by either 3 or 5, it prints the number itself.
